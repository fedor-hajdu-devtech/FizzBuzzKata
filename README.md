Sample project to demonstrate simple TDD principles

I wanted to demonstrate the GREEN/RED TDD principle with the Validation project, but messed the commits. So I've added this mini sample to show the principle, and to show when refactoring should be done.

More details will be visible in Validation project but with late start.
